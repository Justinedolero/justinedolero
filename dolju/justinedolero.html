     <br>
        <p>Bangus, also known as milkfish, is a versatile and popular fish in Asian cuisine.
           Recognized for its tender, boneless flesh and mild flavor, bangus is often grilled, fried, or smoked. This species thrives in both salt and freshwater environments, making it a vital part of aquaculture. Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals, bangus is not only delicious but also a nutritious addition to meals. Its popularity extends to various Filipino dishes, such as "sinigang," "bangus sisig," and "bangus belly adobo." As a sustainable seafood choice, bangus plays a significant role in culinary traditions and aquaculture practices.</p>

        <p>Bangus Belly with Fried Rice</p>
        <p> The belly part of bangus is probably the favorite part of every Filipino. The fish’s belly provides this softer meat that just melts into your mouth even when it’s fried. Add in a marinade mixture of delicious ingredients and you got yourself a winner.</p>
        <p>You’ll need slices of bangus belly for this recipe arranged side by side in a casserole. Marinade the fish in the casserole using water, vinegar, and sampalok sinigang mix. Top the mixture with choices of vegetables and seasoning. Cook the fish with the mixture and boil to a simmer.</p>

            <p>Adobong Bangus</p>
             <p>Combining the unofficial national dish of the Philippines with its unofficial national fish will be like uniting two national icons. Adobo is a cooking method of marinating different kinds of meat in vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, and bay leaves then reducing the meat mixture. 
                This creates this rich sour and salty flavor and tenderizes the meat.
